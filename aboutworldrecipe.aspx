    <font face="Arial" size="2">This application is aim to those who wants to explore and practice/play with ASP .NET without using VS .NET. I wrote this app entirely in notepad just like my other site (www.ex-designz.net), and use
      server map path database connection string. To install it, all you have to do is unzipped the file in the root directory, and you're ready to go...Furthermore, this application does not have dll, user
      control, code-behind, it's written in an in-line code. So if you are a savvy classic ASP coder, you'll never have any problem modifying and running the application in your local PC. There are so many things you can with this application, you can create an article
      directory, link directory, download and many more...</font>
